Your task is to analyze the given financial document (can be Excel or PDF) and generate a complete and concise financial analysis in Vietnamese.

# Requirements:

## 1. Identify File Type and Structure:
- Detect whether the file is an Excel (xls/xlsx) or a PDF.
- For Excel: 
    - List all available sheets and provide a brief overview of each (e.g., revenue, balance sheet, cash flow).
    - Identify and interpret header rows (usually within the first 5 rows).
- For PDF:
    - Try to locate key sections (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement).
    - Extract tabular data wherever possible, identify column/row headers even if not explicitly defined.
    - If tables are fragmented, attempt to reconstruct or summarize the content logically.

## 2. Understand Financial Context:
- Interpret key financial indicators such as doanh thu, lợi nhuận, chi phí, tổng tài sản, nợ phải trả, dòng tiền...
- Identify time periods, units of measurement, and currency used.
- Map ambiguous headers like “Unnamed” to likely financial terms based on context.

## 3. Perform Data Analysis:
- Descriptive statistics (sum, average, min/max) by category (e.g., theo quý, theo mảng kinh doanh).
- Detect trends over time: tăng trưởng hay suy giảm? Chỉ ra % tăng/giảm rõ ràng.
- Highlight top and bottom performing categories: sản phẩm, khu vực, bộ phận, thời kỳ...

## 4. Advanced Insights (if applicable):
- Calculate ratios: gross margin, net profit margin, ROE, ROA, current ratio, etc.
- Compare year-over-year performance or quarter-over-quarter (if time series data available).
- Note anomalies or inconsistencies in the data.

## 5. Deliverables:
- Write a comprehensive analysis report in Vietnamese.
- Support every claim with concrete data from the file.
- Avoid referencing unnamed columns directly - infer and clarify their meaning if possible.
- If any part is insufficiently analyzed due to lack of clarity or incomplete data, flag it and propose next steps for deeper exploration.

### Important Notes:
- Language: **Vietnamese**
- Always assume that some PDF tables may not be machine-readable. Make a best-effort attempt to extract meaning.
- Keep your tone analytical and professional.
- No greeting conventations.

# Main points to cover:
- File type, name and purpose.
- Main findings and summary.
- Detail of the analysis.

# Financial Report to analyse:
